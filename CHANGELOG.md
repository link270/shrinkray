## [1.8.0] - 2026-01-15

### Added
- **HDR detection and tonemapping support** (#65)
  - Automatic HDR detection via color metadata (HDR10/PQ, HLG) with 10-bit BT.2020 fallback
  - Optional HDR-to-SDR tonemapping using software zscale filter (works on all systems)
  - HDR badge displayed on jobs and files in the UI
  - Tonemap toggle in Settings (default: OFF to preserve HDR metadata)
  - When tonemapping is disabled, HDR content preserves 10-bit p010 format and BT.2020 color
  - Hardware encoding still used when tonemapping - only the filter runs on CPU
- **Distinct "Skipped" status for already-encoded files** (#72)
  - Files already in target codec now show "Skipped" (yellow) instead of "Failed" (red)
  - Clearer distinction between actual failures and intentionally skipped files

- **Retry no longer leaves stale job entries in queue**
  - Added SSE "removed" event so all connected clients update when a job is deleted
  - Fixes duplicate/ghost jobs appearing after clicking Retry
- **Clear button now respects queue filter** (#55)
  - When a filter is active (e.g., "Failed"), Clear only removes jobs matching that filter
  - Clear button disabled when viewing Running filter (can't clear running jobs)

## [1.7.0] - 2026-01-11

### Added
- **Stop All / Resume button** (#49)
  - New button in queue footer to pause all running jobs
  - Running jobs are requeued and restart from the beginning when resumed
  - Auto-unpauses when new jobs are added to prevent accidental blocking
  - Button syncs state with queue (shows "Resume" when paused)

### Fixed
- **Queue scroll position preserved during job updates** (#51)

## [1.6.1] - 2026-01-09

### Fixed
- **Jobs no longer lost when reducing worker count** (#43)
  - When reducing concurrent workers (e.g., 3→2), running jobs are now requeued to the front of the pending queue instead of being lost
  - Added `Requeue()` method to safely return interrupted jobs to pending status

## [1.6.0] - 2026-01-09

### Added
- **MP4 output container option** (#44)
  - New setting in Advanced Settings to output MP4 instead of MKV
  - MP4 mode transcodes audio to AAC stereo and strips subtitles for web/direct play compatibility

- Version displayed in startup splash screen
- Version field added to "Shrinkray started" log line for easier debugging

### Changed
- Updated CI to golangci-lint v2.8.0
- Refreshed splash screen text

## [1.5.0] - 2026-01-09

### Added
- **SQLite database for job persistence** - Jobs are now stored in SQLite instead of JSON for better performance and reliability
  - Automatic migration from queue.json to shrinkray.db on first run
  - JSON backup created before migration (queue.json.backup)
  - Supports large queues (1000+ jobs) with proper indexing
- **Session and lifetime space saved tracking** (#31)
  - Header shows session saved (resets when you choose)

## [1.4.12] - 2026-01-08

### Fixed
- Fix running jobs skipped on container restart (#35)
  - When container restarts while jobs are encoding, those jobs now correctly reset to pending
  - Reset state is immediately persisted to disk so it survives further restarts
  - Jobs restart from the beginning in the correct order

## [1.4.11] - 2026-01-08

### Fixed
- Fix QSV encoding failure on MKVs with embedded cover art (#40)
  - MKV files with attached pictures (cover art) have multiple video streams
  - Previous `-map 0` copied all streams, causing QSV to fail encoding JPEG images
  - Now uses explicit stream mapping: `-map 0:v:0 -map 0:a? -map 0:s?`
  - Only maps primary video, all audio, and all subtitles (skips cover art)

### Changed
- Code cleanup: consolidated duplicate utilities, removed dead code, documented magic numbers

## [1.4.10] - 2026-01-08

### Fixed
- All hardware encoders (QSV, VAAPI, NVENC) now automatically retry with software decode when hardware decode fails (#38, #32)
  - Fixes AV1 files on pre-11th gen Intel which can't hardware decode AV1
  - Fixes VC1, MPEG4-ASP, and other codecs that hardware decoders don't support
  - First attempt uses full hardware acceleration
  - If decode fails, automatically retries with software decode + hardware encode
  - Users with capable hardware still get full HW acceleration
  - Fallback is transparent—no user intervention required

## [1.4.9] - 2026-01-08

### Fixed
- Fix QSV encoding failures when hardware decode falls back to software (#32, #38)
  - Changed filter chain to `format=nv12|qsv,hwupload=extra_hw_frames=64`
  - The pipe syntax accepts either CPU frames (nv12) or GPU frames (qsv) without forced conversion
  - HW decode path: zero-copy passthrough (no performance impact)
  - SW decode path: frames uploaded to GPU via hwupload
  - Matches the pattern used by Jellyfin and our working VAAPI implementation

## [1.4.8] - 2026-01-08

### Fixed
- QSV encoding now properly handles software decode fallback (#32, #38)
  - Previous fix using `vpp_qsv` was incorrect - it can't accept CPU frames
  - Now uses `hwupload=extra_hw_frames=64` like Jellyfin does
  - Added `-init_hw_device qsv=qsv -filter_hw_device qsv` for proper device initialization
  - VC1 and other codecs that QSV can't hardware decode now transcode correctly
  - Note: This fix was incomplete - see 1.4.9

## [1.4.7] - 2026-01-08

### Fixed
- QSV encoding now works for compress presets when hardware decode falls back to software (#38)
  - Added `vpp_qsv` base filter to handle CPU-to-QSV frame upload (note: this fix was incomplete, see 1.4.8)

## [1.4.6] - 2026-01-07

### Fixed
- Speed and ETA now display correctly during VAAPI hardware encodes (#29)
  - When FFmpeg reports N/A for time/speed, calculate from frame count and elapsed time

## [1.4.5] - 2026-01-07

### Fixed
